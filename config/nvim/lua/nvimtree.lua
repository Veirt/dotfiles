-- <CR> or o on .. will cd in the above directory
-- <C-]> will cd in the directory under the cursor
-- <BS> will close current opened directory or parent
-- type a to add a file. Adding a directory requires leaving a leading / at the end of the path.
-- type r to rename a file
-- type <C-r> to rename a file and omit the filename on input
-- type x to add/remove file/directory to cut clipboard
-- type c to add/remove file/directory to copy clipboard
-- type y will copy name to system clipboard
-- type Y will copy relative path to system clipboard
-- type gy will copy absolute path to system clipboard
-- type p to paste from clipboard. Cut clipboard has precedence over copy (will prompt for confirmation)
-- type d to delete a file (will prompt for confirmation)
-- type ]c to go to next git item
-- type [c to go to prev git item
-- type - to navigate up to the parent directory of the current file/directory
-- type s to open a file with default system application or a folder with default file manager (if you want to change the command used to do it see :h g:nvim_tree_system_open_command and :h g:nvim_tree_system_open_command_args)
-- if the file is a directory, <CR> will open the directory otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
-- if the file is a symlink, <CR> will follow the symlink (if the target is a file)
-- <C-v> will open the file in a vertical split
-- <C-x> will open the file in a horizontal split
-- <C-t> will open the file in a new tab
-- <Tab> will open the file as a preview (keeps the cursor in the tree)
-- I will toggle visibility of folders hidden via |g:nvim_tree_ignore|
-- H will toggle visibility of dotfiles (files/folders starting with a .)
-- R will refresh the tree
-- Double left click acts like <CR>
-- Double right click acts like <C-]>
